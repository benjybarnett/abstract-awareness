# Unit testing framework ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

This folder contains unit tests for all classifiers, the main classification functions, and the optimisers. 
[`run_all_unittests`](run_all_unittests.m) executes all unit tests and outputs the number of fails (hopefully none).


The [`simulation`](../simulation/) folder contains functions for creating simulated data, some of which are used during unit testing.
