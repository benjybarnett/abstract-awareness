function [perf,result] = mv_searchlight(cfg, X, clabel)
% Classification using a feature searchlight approach can highlight which
% feature(s) are informative. To this end, classification is performed on 
% each feature separately. However, neighbouring features can enter the 
% classification together when a matrix of size [features x features]
% specifying the neighbours is provided.
%
% Usage:
% [perf, ...] = mv_searchlight(cfg,X,clabel)
%
%Parameters:
% X              - [samples x features] data matrix or a 
%                  [samples x features x time] matrix. In the latter case,
%                  either all time points are used as features (if
%                  average=0) or they are averaged to one time (average=1)
% clabel         - [samples x 1] vector of class labels containing
%                  1's (class 1) and 2's (class 2)
%
% cfg          - struct with parameters:
% .metric       - classifier performance metric, default 'accuracy'. See
%                 mv_classifier_performance. If set to [] or 'none', the 
%                 raw classifier output (labels, dvals or probabilities 
%                 depending on cfg.output_type) for each sample is returned. 
%                 Use cell array to specify multiple metrics (eg
%                 {'accuracy' 'auc'}
% .neighbours  - [features x features] matrix specifying which features
%                are neighbours of each other.
%                          - EITHER - 
%                a GRAPH consisting of 0's and 1's. A 1 in the 
%                (i,j)-th element signifies that feature i and feature j 
%                are neighbours, and a 0 means they are not neighbours
%                            - OR -
%                a DISTANCE MATRIX, where larger values mean larger distance.
%                If no matrix is provided, every feature is only neighbour
%                to itself and classification is performed for each feature 
%                separately.
% .size        - if a neighbours matrix is provided, size defines the 
%                size of the 'neighbourhood' of a feature.
%                if neighbours is a graph, it gives the number of steps taken 
%                     through the neighbours matrix to find neighbours:
%                     0: only the feature itself is considered (no neighbours)
%                     1: the feature and its immediate neighbours
%                     2: the feature, its neighbours, and its neighbours'
%                     neighbours
%                     3+: neighbours of neighbours of neighbours etc
%                     (default 1)
%                if neighbours is a distance matrix, size defines the number of
%                     neighbouring features that enter the classification
%                     0: only the feature itself is considered (no neighbours)
%                     1: the feature and its first closest neighbour 
%                        according to the distance matrix
%                     2+: the 2 closest neighbours etc.
% .average     - if 1 and X is [samples x features x time], the time
%                dimension is averaged ot a single feature (default 0). If
%                0, each time point is used as a separate feature
% .feedback     - print feedback on the console (default 1)
%
% CROSS-VALIDATION parameters:
% .cv           - perform cross-validation, can be set to 'kfold',
%                 'leaveout', 'holdout', 'leavegroupout' or 'none' (default 'kfold')
% .k            - number of folds in k-fold cross-validation (default 5)
% .p            - if cv is 'holdout', p is the fraction of test samples
%                 (default 0.1)
% .stratify     - if 1, the class proportions are approximately preserved
%                 in each fold (default 1)
% .repeat       - number of times the cross-validation is repeated with new
%                 randomly assigned folds (default 1)
%
% PREPROCESSING parameters: and 
% .preprocess         - cell array containing the preprocessing pipeline. The
%                       pipeline is applied in chronological order
% .preprocess_param   - cell array of preprocessing parameter structs for each
%                       function. Length of preprocess_param must match length
%                       of preprocess
%
% Returns:
% perf          - [features x 1] vector of classifier performances 
%                 corresponding to the selected metric
%                 If multiple metrics are requested, perf is a cell array
