function [cf,Sw,lambda,mu1,mu2] = train_lda(param,X,clabel)
% Trains a linear discriminant analysis with regularization of the 
% covariance matrix.
%
% Usage:
% cf = train_lda(param,X,clabel)
%
%Parameters:
% X              - [samples x features] matrix of training samples
% clabel         - [samples x 1] vector of class labels
%
% param          - struct with hyperparameters:
% .reg          - type of regularization
%                 'shrink': shrinkage regularization using (1-lambda)*Sw +
%                          lambda*nu*I, where Sw is the scatter matrix,
%                          I is the identity matrix, nu = trace(Sw)/P and 
%                          P = number of features. nu assures that the trace of
%                          Sw is equal to the trace of the regularization
%                          term. 
%                 'ridge': ridge-type regularization using Sw + lambda*I
%                  (default 'shrink')
% .lambda        - if reg='shrink', the regularization parameter ranges 
%                  from 0 to 1 (where 0=no regularization and 1=maximum
%                  regularization). If 'auto' then the shrinkage 
%                  regularization parameter is calculated automatically 
%                  using the Ledoit-Wolf formula(function cov1para.m). 
%                  If reg='ridge', lambda ranges from 0 (no regularization)
%                  to infinity.
%                  If multiple values are given, a grid search is performed
%                  for the best lambda (only for reg='shrink')
% .prob          - if 1, decision values are returned as probabilities. If
%                  0, the decision values are simply the distance to the
%                  hyperplane. Calculating probabilities takes more time
%                  and memory so don't use this unless needed. Probabilities 
%                  can be unreliable in high dimensions (default 0). Note
%                  that for probabilities the covariance matrix needs to be
%                  calculated, so it can only be used in primal form (hence
%                  set hyperparameter.form = 'primal')
% .scale         - if 1, the projection vector w is scaled such that the
%                  mean of class 1 (on the training data) projects onto +1
%                  and the mean of class 2 (on the training data) projects
%                  onto -1
% .form          - uses the 'primal' or 'dual' form of the solution to
%                  determine w. If 'auto', auomatically chooses the most 
%                  efficient form depending on whether #samples > #features
%                  (default 'auto'). 'primal' corresponds to the standard
%                  LDA approach using the features x features covariance
%                  matrix. 'dual' uses the samples x samples Gram matrix
%                  instead. In both cases, w is calculated.
%
%Output:
% cf - struct specifying the classifier with the following fields:
% w            - projection vector (normal to the hyperplane)
% b            - bias term, setting the threshold
%
% The following output arguments can be returned optionally:
% Sw           - covariance matrix (possibly regularized)
% mu1,mu2      - class means
% n            - total number of samples
